       Animal Jam is an online multiplayer game designed for children aged 7 to 14. 
       Developed by <a class="different-color-link" href="https://www.wildworks.com/#welcome" target="_blank">Wildworks</a>in partnership with <a class="different-color-link" href="https://www.natgeokids.com/uk/kids-club/entertainment/general-entertainment/what-is-animal-jam/" target="_blank">National Geographic</a>, the game allows players to create and customize their own animal avatars, explore a vibrant virtual world, and engage in various educational activities.

        Animal Jam had to create an installer due to the discontinuation of Adobe Flash. Flash was a technology commonly used to run multimedia content, including games, animations, and interactive applications on the internet. However, Adobe announced that it would stop supporting and distributing Flash Player by the end of 2020 due to security vulnerabilities and the rise of more modern web technologies.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="text-position" class="Kavivanar">
        As a result, web-based games like Animal Jam that relied on Flash needed to find alternative solutions to continue operating. WildWorks, the developer of "Animal Jam," opted to create an installer for the game. This allowed players to download and install the game directly onto their devices, rather than accessing it through a web browser that previously relied on Flash technology.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="text-position" class="Kavivanar">
        By transitioning to an installer-based model, Animal Jam could ensure that players could continue enjoying the game without being dependent on Flash. This move also provided an opportunity for the developers to update and optimize the game for modern platforms and technologies, ensuring its continued availability and compatibility with evolving internet standards.
